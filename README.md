This is a simple login application in Android. It has a username and a password. 
The default username is “a” and password is “b”. After the user logs in, it can be changed in settings.

We started by designing it on a sheet of paper. We thought about the login page to contain 2 boxes where the user to enter the username and password and a login button.
After logging in a menu appears from where the user can choose Settings in order to change the password or HomeWork page where something will be displayed.
Everything seemed ok and we implemented the code.

It can run on any Android device because the requirements are low.

Over the last weeks, Radu and I worked on an Android browser app and we included the login in it. The following screenshots are taken from the app running on a Samsung S4.
